simple-priority-queue-server
============================

A simple Node.js-based server for ordering tasks based on a priority.

Using the included web form you can submit tasks with a priority and retrieve the highest-priority task. Presumably the service could also be utilized by non-browser REST clients. For example, it could coordinate work among components in a distributed system.

This is intended as educational material. I remember reading an interview question back around 2008 or 2009 asking how you would implement a priority queue service, so I guess there are people out there who might find this information useful.
